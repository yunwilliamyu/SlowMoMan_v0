# Update
This is an old v0 of SlowMoMan. For a version with more quality-of-life features using the D3 library: 
- https://github.com/yunwilliamyu/SlowMoMan
- https://yunwilliamyu.github.io/SlowMoMan/

We keep this version around because it is substantially more efficient for extremely large data sets.
